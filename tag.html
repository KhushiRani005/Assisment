<!-- HTML headings, from <h1> to <h6>, indicate content hierarchy and importance. Search engines use them for indexing. Users navigate by headings. Employ <h1> for main titles, <h2> for subsections, and progressively lower levels for less important content to maintain structure and readability.

    HTML provides six levels of heading elements, ranging from <h1> (highest level) to <h6> (lowest level).
    
    Purpose and Usage of Heading Tags:
    1. <h1> – Main Heading (Largest):
    Represents the primary topic of the page.
    Use it sparingly to maintain clarity.
    2. <h2> – Subheadings:
    Ideal for dividing content into sections.
    If further subsections exist, employ <h3> elements.
    3. <h3> to <h6> – Smaller Headings:
    Gradually decrease in size.
    Use them for finer subdivisions. -->
